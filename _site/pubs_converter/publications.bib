  title     = "From Legacy to Cloud: Risks and Benefits in Software Cloud Migration",
  abstract  = "The cloud has quickly become a disruptive technology, especially when it comes to the way enterprises run their IT. What began as a pioneering idea of companies such as Amazon and Google, quickly started to gain in popularity among enterprises. The main reason is the tremendous potential in cost savings that can be achieved. As Nati Shalom reports in her article “Moving Enterprise Workloads to the Cloud” [15], on a massive scale the cost savings that can be achieved reach 21% if only three mission-critical applications weremoved to the cloud. Another driver towardsmigration is the maturing of cloud technology in areas that were considered as the biggest deal-breakers for migration such as security or complexity. Different degrees of SLAs and offerings in the form of IaaS, PaaS or SaaS seem to be able to accommodate the plethora of enterprise needs. Yet, all these benefits can be achieved only if the application is suitable for the cloud. This suitability, however, is not limited to the technical characteristics of the application – as many managers still think.The aim of this chapter is to identify and classify the various factors that influence the success of enterprise application migration to the cloud. If known, addressing these factors can guide enterprises in deciding if a selected cloud environment is right for the considered software applications. The study also helps break the myth that migration is a one-time project.",

  title     = "Modeling Context with an Architecture Viewpoint",
  abstract  = "The context of a software system comprises the knowledge that architects need to have about the environment in which a system is expected to operate. %As such, it is a crucial software architecture consideration.Contextual knowledge, however, is often unknown or overlooked. This results in software architects designing systems based on assumptions that are largely unfounded and can potentially lead to system failures. To address this problem, this paper presents a {\em Context Description Viewpoint} that captures context in software architecture. The viewpoint is based on the results of a literature review that analyzed the state-of-the-art in context, its elements, and modeling techniques. We evaluated and revised the viewpoint by using two case studies based on real-world projects. The case studies showed that the viewpoint is expressive enough to capture context. For software architects it represents a reusable work product to design software systems and to help them identify, capture, and analyze contextual knowledge.",

However, the knowledge is fragmented over a wide range of heterogeneous studies. Our aim is to build a systematic body of knowledge to support architectural decision-making and design. If available, this knowledge helps architects in addressing quality requirements consciously and more explicitly, i.e. in quality-driven pattern-based design. In order to build that body of knowledge we carried out a systematic literature review. We identified 99 primary studies for the analysis. The resulting data shows a wide spectrum of approaches encompassing patterns and quality attributes. In this study we (1a) present in which way patterns and quality attributes interact and (1b) provide quantitative data on the frequency of appearance for both patterns and quality attributes; (2) give an overview of the approaches we elicited from the analysis; and (3) provide our insights regarding a specific challenge (combination of patterns). Our analysis is a first step toward a theory on the architectural patterns and quality attribute interaction.",

We use it to store our documents (Dropbox), to stream our music and lms (Spotify and Net ix) and without giving it any thought, we use it to work on documents in the cloud (Google Docs). The cloud forms a massive storage and processing system for an increasing amount of our digital activities. Not only consumers, but companies too are using the cloud more and more for the storage of data and to host software applications in. Behind the virtual cloud is a world of physical data centers, connected globally, packed with servers that enable us to store documents, use processing power and send data regardless of where we are or which device we use. These data centers consume a large amounts of energy, comparable with the amount consumed by the aviation industry.Although data centers work on saving energy, in particular by means of e cient cooling techniques and energy e cient servers, the growing demand for data center capacity makes it hard to realise absolute energy savings. Whereas on the one hand servers are rapidly becoming more energy e cient, this e ect is cancelled out by software that consumes increasing amounts of energy. It is expected that as a result the energy consumption of (new) data centers will keep rising in the future. Solutions with energy e cient cooling techniques end renewable energy are in- su cient. Most energy savings of hardware can be achieved by looking at the source of the energy load: the software that runs on the hardware. After all, it is the software that controls the processors, the memory, the network ports and all other components of the server.",

The problem solving ability of Mind 1 has often been emphasized in software engineering. The reflective Mind 2, however, has not received much attention. In this study, we want to find out if Mind 2, or reflection, can improve design discourse, a prerequisite of design quality. We conducted multiple case studies with 12 student groups, divided into test groups and control groups. We provided external reflections to the test groups. No reflections were given to the control groups. We analyzed the quality of the design discourse in both groups. We found that reflection (Mind 2) improves the quality of design discourse (Mind 1) under certain preconditions. The results highlight the significance of reflection as a mean to improve the quality of design discourse. We conclude that software designers need both Mind 1 and Mind 2 to obtain a higher quality design discourse, as a foundation for a good design.",

The relation between patterns (or styles) and quality attributes has been regularly addressed in the literature. However, there is a lack of a consolidated and systematically built reference capturing this relation and eventually making it available for reuse in the form of patterns-quality attributes knowledge. If captured, this knowledge can be used as an architectural decision framework where solutions (patterns) are strongly intertwined with quality (attributes). Such a framework should also contemplate variants and combinations of patterns. In order to create the framework, we first proposed a lightweight theory on the interaction of patterns/styles and quality attributes. That framework has been built by starting from a key study on the interaction between architectural patterns and quality attributes. We then challenged the theory against the systematic survey of a pilot set of primary studies. This paper presents the preliminary results of this survey on architectural patterns and styles, and their interaction with quality attributes. The preliminary results show that the initial theory can work as a platform for integrating the body of knowledge gathered through the analysis.",

This study aims at assessing the impact, in terms of energy savings, of best practices for achieving software energy efficiency, elicited from previous work. By doing so, it identifies which resources are affected by the practices and the possible trade-offs with energy consumption. Method. We performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment, where we applied two different Green Software practices to two software applications, namely query optimization in MySQL Server and usage of {"}sleep{"} instruction in the Apache web server. We then performed a comparison of the energy consumption at system-level and at resource-level, before and after applying the practice. Results. Our results show that both practices are effective in improving software energy efficiency, reducing consumption up to 25%. We observe that after applying the practices, resource usage is more energy-proportional i.e., increasing CPU usage increases energy consumption in an almost linear way. We also provide our reflections on empirical experimentation in software energy efficiency. Conclusions. Our contribution shows that significant improvements in software energy efficiency can be gained by applying best practices during design and development. Future work will be devoted to further validate best practices, and to improve their reusability.",

The selected approaches are: plain SQL queries in the source code, and two specialized frameworks, Propel and TinyQueries.Method. We performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment. We selected three factors for our experimentation: the different ORM approaches, the type of query (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and the size of database tables. Our response variables were execution time and energy consumption.Results. As expected, pure SQL yielded the best performance and energy efficiency in all test cases. Propel exhibited a much higher energy consumption and longer execution times. The TinyQueries tool performed slightly worse than SQL, but significantly better than Propel, offering a convenient trade--off between ORM benefits and energy efficiency.Conclusions. Our experiment shows that ORM approaches have a significant impact on both energy consumption and performance.

Achieving gender diversity in IT-related fields has been a goal for decades, but still, too few women choose such a career. But what skills or traits assigned to the feminine role bring concrete advantages to software teams? Researchers addressed this important and, strangely enough, mostly unexplored problem, specifically for software-architecting teams. They interviewed male and female software architects at four major IT companies in the Netherlands and then interviewed a panel of experts. They identified seven feminine expertise 'flavors' - traits and skills linked to the feminine role in architecting teams.

  abstract  = "In the quest for energy efficiency of Information and Communication Technology, so far research has mostly focused on the role of hardware. However, as hardware technology becomes more sophisticated, the role of software becomes crucial. Recently, the impact of software on energy consumption has been acknowledged as significant by researchers in software engineering. In spite of that, measuring the energy consumption of software has proven to be a challenge, due to the large number of variables that need to be controlled to obtain reliable measurements. Due to cost and time constraints, many software product organizations are unable to effectively measure the energy consumption of software. This prevents them to be in control over the energy efficiency of their products.In this paper, we propose a software energy profiling method to reliably compare the energy consumed by a software product across different releases, from the perspective of a software organization. Our method allows to attribute differences in energy consumption to changes in the software. We validate our profiling method through an empirical experiment on two consecutive releases of a commercial software product. We demonstrate how the method can be applied by organizations and provide an analysis of the software related changes in energy consumption. Our results show that, despite a lack of precise measurements, energy consumption differences between releases of a software product can be quantified down to the level of individual processes. Additionally, the results provide insights on how specific software changes might affect energy consumption.",

  abstract = "When Service Orientation was introduced as the solution for retaining and rehabilitating legacy assets, both researchers and practitioners proposed techniques, methods, and guidelines for SOA migration. With so much hype surrounding SOA, it is not surprising that the concept was interpreted in many different ways, and consequently, different approaches to SOA migration were proposed. Accordingly, soon there was an abundance of methods that were hard to compare and eventually adopt. Against this backdrop, this paper reports on a systematic literature review that was conducted to extract the categories of SOA migration proposed by the research community. We provide the state-of-the-art in SOA migration approaches, and discuss categories of activities carried out and knowledge elements used or produced in those approaches. From such categorization, we derive a reference model, called SOA migration frame of reference, that can be used for selecting and defining SOA migration approaches. As a co-product of the analysis, we shed light on how SOA migration is perceived in the field, which further points to promising future research directions. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

Users can choose among several existing tools to determine the energy profile of a running application in order to provide more sustainable software. We conducted a field study in the SURFsara data center and we experimented with the tools available, assessing them in light of their informative power. We derived some recommendations for ICT users and infrastructure operators that highlight the relation between the intended use of the profile and the easiness of running a specific tool. We categorize users in two types: the generic user, who is interested in summary statistical results on power measurements and the software developer that intends to delve in the code details in order to reprogram the application more efficiently. We concluded that SLURM and Score-P are suitable for both types of users when their requirements are thoroughly studied and taken into account.",

There are many domains and applications that can benefit from the longer battery life and better application performance on mobile devices that is typically associated to the use of cyber-foraging, such as field operations, sensor systems, and entertainment. However, obtaining these benefits in operational systems requires meeting functional and non-functional requirements that vary depending on the usage context of the cyber-foraging system. This paper presents a characterization of usage contexts for cyber-foraging defined in terms of functional and non-functional requirements for cyber-foraging systems. The goal of the characterization is to provide context for software engineering life cycle activities for cyber-foraging systems, such as requirements engineering, software architecture and quality assurance, with the intent of developing systems that fully realize the benefits of cyber-foraging.",

We investigate the state of the art in energy-efficient networking solutions in cloud-based environments. We follow a systematic literature review method to select primary studies. We create a metamodel based on the codes extracted from our primary studies using the Coding analytical method. Our findings show three abstraction levelsof the proposed networking solutions to achieve energy efficiency in cloud-based environments: Strategy, Solution, and Technology.

The framework helps draw a more comprehensive picture of the relevant quality dimensions and, as a result, improve decision making. Sustainability is achievable only when accounting for all dimensions. Connections among the four dimensions involve different dependencies and stakeholders. The framework aims to capture the relevant qualities that characterize sustainability concerns of software systems, helping identify how these qualities influence each other with respect to the different aspects of sustainability. Moreover, interdependent quality requirements may influence one another, as in association/association-class influences among sustainability quality requirements. Integrating our four-dimensional sustainability analysis framework into the engineering processes of long-lived industrial systems provides valuable support to managers and engineers trying to satisfy not only economic and technical but also environmental and social sustainability requirements. The influences among the sustainability quality requirements must be determined by developers and/or stakeholders, as the framework can provide only the means for linking them but not the analysis itself. Constraints and parameters must be chosen by the developers, as it is not possible to list them in a way that is generic enough to be applicable in all circumstances and at the same time specific enough to be useful.",

In the case of social debt, decisions are about people and their interactions. Our objective was to study the causality around social debt in practice. In so doing, we conducted exploratory qualitative research in a large software company. We found many forces together causing social debt; we represented them in a framework, and captured anti-patterns that led to the debt in the first place. Finally, we elicited best practices that technicians adopted to pay back some of the accumulated debt. We learned that social debt is strongly correlated with technical debt and both forces should be reckoned with together during the software process.",

This prevents them from being generalized and shared with the community. In this paper, we present a web-based tool that tackles both needs: on one hand, the tool enables practitioners (i.e. agents) to browse a number of Green ICT solutions and calculate their estimated impact if applied to their organization, through customized parameters. On the other hand, the tool also provides a creation interface for contributors who want to generalize and share their own Green ICT practices. In addition, we foresee that the data generated by the usage of the tool will provide useful insights and trends regarding the adoption of Green ICT and its effectiveness on reducing CO2 emissions.",

  abstract  = "Service-oriented computing is a promising computing paradigm which facilitates the composition of loosely coupled and adaptable applications. Unfortunately, this new paradigm does not lend itself easily to traditional software engineering methods and principles due to the decentralised nature of software services. The goal of this paper is to identify a set of engineering activities that can be used to develop adaptable service-based applications. Rather than focusing on the entire service-based application development life-cycle, this paper will focus on adaptation-specific processes and activities and map them to an existing high-level service-based application development life-cycle. Existing software engineering literature as well as research results from service engineering research is reviewed for relevant activities. The result is an adaptation framework that can guide software engineers in developing adaptable service-based applications. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.",

  title     = "3D Architecture Viewpoints on Service Automation",
  abstract  = "Service-oriented architecture is an emerging paradigm for the execution of business-oriented as well as technical infrastructure processes by means of services. Automating the execution of services is of paramount importance in order to fulfill the needs of companies. However we have found that automation-although important-is seldom addressed explicitly as a concern when stating requirements or designing the software architecture of the service-based applications (SBAs). In this paper we define three architectural viewpoints framing the concerns about service automation. These three viewpoints, called 3D (Decisions, Degree, Data), respectively: express architectural decisions about automation; help identifying the level (degree) of automation required, and represent the specific data required to support automation in services. They have been applied to three industrial case studies and one academic experiment. Results show that they successfully support both technical and non-technical stakeholders in understanding how, and communicating upon, their concerns related to service automation have been addressed. The application of the 3D service automation viewpoints to different domains exhibits promising reusability.© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

Organizational and social literature call this interplay an Organizational Social Structure (OSS). Software practitioners still lack a systematic way to select, analyze, and support OSSs best fitting their problems (e.g., software development).We provide the state-of-the-art in OSSs, and discussmechanisms to support OSS-related decisions in software engineering (e.g., choosing the OSS best fitting development scenarios). Our data supports two conclusions. First, software engineering focused on building software using project teams alone, yet these are one of thirteen OSS flavors from literature. Second, an emerging OSS should be further explored for software development: social networks. This article represents a first glimpse at OSS-aware software engineering, that is, to engineer software using OSSs best fit for the problem. © 2013 ACM.",

  abstract  = "To achieve lower energy consumption many green strategies (e.g. virtualize applications and consolidate them on shared server machines, or optimize the usage of the private cloud by opening up to external consumers) have been discussed. In practice, however, the major incentive for a company to go green is reducing costs. While green strategies often focus on technical and environmental issues, they hardly address the economic impact that they may bring. If green strategies do not lead to an explicit (and significant) reduction of costs (hence increase in revenues) they are nice but not part of the business strategy of the company. In this paper we propose a green strategy model that provides decision makers with the information needed to decide on whether to take green strategies and eventually how to align them with their business strategies. This model provides a means to codify green strategies in such a way that the link between green strategies, their economic impact and green goals becomes explicit. We applied the model in a case study to codify 132 green actions collected from Dutch data centers. This exercise further confirmed the advantage of using the proposed model and helped us identifying future improvements. © 2012 IEEE.",

  abstract  = "To teach global software engineering, we devised a complementary distributed module with a shared project involving both local and international teams. In local teams, students are located at the same university and trained in one of the two complementary topics. In international teams, students are located at two different universities and trained in one of the two complementary topics. This study empirically investigates whether the students in the international teams can compensate the extra effort required to deal with communication, coordination, and collaboration issues that characterize global software engineering projects with learning by osmosis (i.e., by transferring knowledge among globally distributed teams trained on different topics). The results show that there was no statistically significant difference between the performance of local and international teams.We assert that the students in the international and local teams perform equally well, thanks to learning by osmosis. However, our analysis of the self-reported questionnaire data revealed that most of the participants (i.e., 70%) would like to work in local teams in real-life project, 74% of the participants thought international teams were less efficient, and 41% of the participants reported lack of trust in their international team members compared with their local team members.

Organizational research calls this interplay of people an Organizational Social Structure (OSS). Previous literature in GSE shows that its OSS is highly dynamic and unpre- dictable. This paper presents a mapping of OSS types onto GSE organizational factors, based on empirical evidence. We made two observations: first, current OSS types don’t support factors related to GSE process management and organizational efficiency (e.g. risk management, language, etc.). Second, OSSs in GSE have attributes which don’t map onto any GSE factor, rather introduce a new one, awareness management (e.g. awareness of skills to others, awareness of tasks, tasks (re-)localization, etc.). Our conclusions are twofold. First, OSSs for GSE should focus on increasing support to process man- agement and organizational efficiency. Lastly, research in GSE should include factors focusing on awareness management.",

  abstract  = "Carbon emission of IT is an issue. ICT energy consumption is expected to grow by 73% (instead of the originally targeted 26%) until 2020, and the service sector alone counts for 70% of the European economy. Energy consumption is a combination of what we use, and how we use it. Most green initiatives look at what types of devices do consume energy, and try to optimize their up-time as such. Few initiatives, though, measure how do software systems actually use these devices, with the goal of optimizing consumption of devices and computing resources. Basic research is needed to address this software optimization problem. The proposed approach is to make visible the environmental impact of software services by measuring it. In this way, we will become aware of the amount of energy needed by our software, and hence learn how to target software optimization where it is mostly needed. As a first step in this direction, in this paper we define three main problem areas to realize green service-based applications, and propose a service-oriented approach to address them. Thanks to that we can bring clarity in what entails managing and developing green software according to environmental strategies. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",

Accordingly, many service-oriented software engineering (SOSE) methodologies have been proposed and practiced in both academia and industry. Some of these methodologies share common features (e. g. cover similar life-cycle phases) but are presented for different purposes, ranging from project management to system modernization, and from business analysis to technical solutions development. Given this diversity in the methodologies available in the literature, it is very hard for a company to decide which methodology would fit best for its specific needs. With this aim, we took a feature analysis approach and devised a framework for comparing the existing SOA methodologies. Different from existing comparison frameworks, ours specifically highlights aspects that are specific to SOA and aims to differentiate the methodologies that are truly service-oriented from those that deal little with service aspects. As such, the criteria defined in the framework can be used as a checklist for selecting a SOSE methodology. © 2011 The Author(s).",

  title     = "Leveraging Software Architectures through the ISO/IEC 42010 standard: A Feasibility Study",
  abstract  = "The state of the practice in enterprise and software architecture learnt that relevant architectural aspects should be illustrated in multiple views, targeting the various concerns of different stakeholders. This has been expressed a.o. in the ISO/IEC 42010 Standard on architecture descriptions. In the same vein, the research community observed that Architecture Description Languages, or ADLs, should be developed to address stakeholders' concerns concentrating on the use of viewpoints for their description. This notwithstanding, we notice today a proliferation of ADLs impervious to these guidelines. This imperviousness creates a gap between what the IT industry requires and what ADLs can provide. This gap makes it impossible for practitioners to choose and use the best-fit ADL for his/her requirements. To fill this gap, we must analyze the existing ADLs, and mine and make explicit their addressed concerns, views, viewpoints, and stakeholders. Such an explicit overview can provide practitioners with pragmatic information for selecting the most suitable ADL, and hence support them in the architecting process. This paper reports on initial results in this direction. Given a specific ADL (namely, DARWIN/FSP), it presents a feasibility study on the methodology mapping the concepts of the ISO/IEC 42010 on the DARWIN/FSP ADL. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

In an attempt to better understand what architects really do and what kind of support they need for sharing knowledge, we have conducted large-scale survey research.

Over a decade there has been an increasing interest in the approaches addressing SOA migration. These approaches mainly differ in 'what is migrated' and 'how the migration is performed'. Such differences aggravate achieving a general understanding of 'what SOA migration entails'. To solve this problem, we conducted a systematic review that extracts main migration categories, called SOA migration families, from the approaches proposed in the research community. Based on the results of the systematic review, we describe eight distinct families along with their characteristics and goals. These families represent a first frame of reference for SOA migration which brings order and enhances understanding on how migration can be carried out. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",

  abstract  = "Traceability is the ability to describe and follow the life of a software artifact and a means for modeling the relations between software artifacts in an explicit way. Traceability has been successfully applied in many software engineering communities and has recently been adopted to document the transition among requirements, architecture and implementation. We present an approach to customize traceability to the situation at hand. Instead of automating tracing, or representing all possible traces, we scope the traces to be maintained to the activities stakeholders must carry out. We define core traceability paths, consisting of essential traceability links required to support the activities. We illustrate the approach through two examples: product derivation in software product lines, and release planning in software process management. By using a running software product line example, we explain why the core traceability paths identified are needed when navigating from feature to structural models and from family to product level and backward between models used in software product derivation. A feasibility study in release planning carried out in an industrial setting further illustrates the use of core traceability paths during production and measures the increase in performance of the development processes supported by our approach. These examples show that our approach can be successfully used to support both product and process traceability in a pragmatic yet efficient way. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

  abstract  = "Service-oriented system engineering (SOSE) has drawn increasing attention since service-oriented computing was introduced in the beginning of this decade. A large number of SOSE challenges that call for special software engineering efforts have been proposed in the research community. Our goal is to gain insight into the current status of SOSE research issues as published to date. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review exploring SOSE challenges that have been claimed between January 2000 and July 2008. This paper presents the results of the systematic review as well as the empirical research method we followed. In this review, of the 729 publications that have been examined, 51 were selected as primary studies, from which more than 400 SOSE challenges were elicited. By applying qualitative data analysis methods to the extracted data from the review, we proved our hypotheses about the classification scheme. We are able to conclude that the SOSE challenges can be classified along two dimensions: (a) based on themes (or topics) that they cover and (b) based on characteristics (or types) that they reveal. By analyzing the distribution of the SOSE challenges on the topics and types in the years 2000-2008, we are able to point out the trend in SOSE research activities. The findings of this review further provide empirical evidence for establishing future SOSE research agendas. © The Author(s) 2009.",

  abstract  = "The software engineering (SE) community has recently recognized that the field lacks well-established research paradigms and clear guidance on how to write good research reports. With no comprehensive guide to the different article types in the field, article writing and reviewing heavily depends on the expertise and the understanding of the individual SE actors. In this work, we classify and describe the article types published in SE with an emphasis on what is required for publication in journals and conference proceedings. Theoretically, we consider article types as genres, because we assume that each type of article has a specific function and a particular communicative purpose within the community, which the members of the community can recognize. We draw on written sources available, i.e. the instructions to authors/reviewers of major SE journals, the calls for papers of major SE conferences, and previous research published on the topic. Despite the fragmentation and limitations of the sources studied, we are able to propose a classification of different SE article types. Such classification helps in guiding the reader through the SE literature, and in making the researcher reflect on directions for improvements. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

  title     = "Recovering Architectural Assumptions",
  abstract  = "During the creation of a software architecture, the architects and stakeholders take a lot of decisions. Many of these decisions can be directly related to functional or quality requirements. Some design decisions, though, are more or less arbitrarily made on the fly because of personal experience, domain knowledge, budget constraints, available expertise, and the like. These decisions, as well as the reasons for those decisions, are often not explicit upfront. They are implicit, and usually remain undocumented. We call them assumptions. There is no accepted way to document assumptions, and the relation between the software architecture and these assumptions easily gets lost, becomes hidden in the girders of the architecture. They are rediscovered at a later stage, when the software evolves and assumptions become invalid or new assumptions contradict earlier ones. In this paper, we develop a method to recover such assumptions from an existing software product. We illustrate the method by applying it to a commercial software product, and show how the results can help assess the evolutionary capabilities of its architecture. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

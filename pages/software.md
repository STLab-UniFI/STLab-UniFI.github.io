ORIS is a tool for quantitative modeling of non-Markovian systems as Stochastic Time Petri Nets (STPNs) and for their quantitative evaluation through the method of stochastic state classes.

ATDx is an approach designed to provide a data-driven, intuitive, and actionable overview of the Architectural Technical Debt present in a portfolio of software projects. ATDx is based on third-party source code analysis tools, architectural issue severity calculation via clustering, and aggregation of measurements into different architectural technical debt dimensions. The ATDx tool allows users to automatically run the ATDx analysis, generate reports containing the ATDx analysis results, and is integrated with GitHub.

EULERO is a Java library implementing a compositional approach to safe approximation of the end-to-end response time Probability Density Function (PDF) of complex workflows, made of activities with general (i.e., non-Exponential) duration possibly with bounded support, composed through sequence, choice/merge, and split/join blocks, with unbalanced split and join constructs that may break the structure of well-formed nesting.

To efficiently develop and mantain Android apps, a paramount factor is how well apps are architected. Based on a mixed-method empirical study, we derived 42 guidelines for architecting Android apps. The guidelines cover SOLID principles, design patterns, dependency injection tools like Dagger, and many more. The guidelines are organized around 4 themes: [MVVM](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#MVVM), [MVP](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#MPV), [Clean](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#Clean), and [Generic](https://androidarchitectureguidelines.github.io/#Generic) guidelines.

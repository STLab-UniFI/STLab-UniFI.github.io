Our end goal is the ever-improvement of the development, maintenance, and quality optimization processes of software products. To do so, we employ a mix of formal and empirical methods to design and evaluate new approaches and algorithms, from their theoretical conception to their hands on experimentation and deployment. 

Keenly interested in technology transfer, we keep thigh bonds with industrial partners to ensure a continuous and fruitful knowledge exchange between academia and industry. 

Our vision is to strive towards formally-proven, evidence-based, and data-driven software engineering solutions, with which we can jointly progress towards higher-quality, more performant, and more sustainable software.

## Focus
Our **focus** is on the following scientific areas of interest:

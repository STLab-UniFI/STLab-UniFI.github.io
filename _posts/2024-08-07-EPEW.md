The research titled "Approximation of First Passage Distributions in Markov Chains with Replicated Components", authored by András Horváth ([UniTO](https://www.unito.it/)), Marco Paolieri ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)), and Enrico Vicario (STLab) was awarded with the best presentation award at the 20th European Performance Engineering Workshop ([EPEW'24](https://epew-workshop.github.io/)).


The research presents a novel approach to estimate the distribution of first passage times for systems with replicated components modeled by continuous-time Markov chains, achieving accurate approximations while significantly reducing computational complexity.

We are proud to share that **Kevin Maggi**, a scholarship researcher at STLab and former master’s thesis student in our laboratory, has been awarded the **Degree Award** by the **Order of Engineers of Florence**. This  recognition celebrates outstanding academic contributions to the engineering field.

Kevin’s thesis, completed one year ago at STLab, focused on the evolution of Code Technical Debt in Microservices Architectures.

A comprehensive understanding of how Technical Debt evolves and accumulates in microservices architectures is crucial to planning a sustainable development evolution and optimizing maintainability interventions. 

The findings highlight the benefits of a microservice-based architecture, which helps compartmentalize Technical Debt within microservices, avoiding its uncontrolled growth as the system complexity increases. 

The research, based on the analysis of open-source projects, was also recently published in an article in the Journal of _Systems and Software_.

This award highlights the innovative work conducted at STLab and the dedication of its members to addressing critical societal challenges through research and technology.

Congratulations to Kevin for this outstanding achievement!

The 17th June 2025 at 10:00-11:00 in Room 057 (Santa Marta) Dr. [Justus Bogner](https://xjreb.github.io/), Assistant Professor at the [Software and Sustainability Group](https://s2group.cs.vu.nl/) of the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl) will hold a lecture on Designing High-Quality Green ML-Enabled Systems.

Following more informations about the invited guest talk.

**Title: The Challenge of Designing High-Quality Green ML-Enabled Systems: A Software Architecture Perspective**

**Abstract*
While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly maturing, it remains very challenging for industry to develop production-ready AI-based systems and to operate and maintain them for longer periods of time. Even though ML models may only be a small piece of these systems, they nonetheless have a profound impact on their functionality and quality attributes, which can be difficult to manage. One important quality attribute that has not received the priority it deserves is environmental sustainability. In this talk, I will briefly introduce how software engineering for AI-based systems (SE4AI) has emerged to try to tackle these problems. I will then take a software architecture perspective on these systems, and finally talk about Green AI by describing our past and ongoing efforts to synthesize and evaluate architectural tactics to improve the environmental sustainability of ML-enabled systems.

*About the Speaker*
Dr. Justus Bogner is an Assistant Professor in Software Engineering at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (S2 group). He worked over nine years as a software engineer at Hewlett Packard and DXC Technology. After earning his PhD in 2020, he spent three years as a postdoc at the University of Stuttgart, leading the "Software Engineering for AI- and Microservice-Based Systems" division. His research focuses on empirical software engineering, architecture, and quality (maintainability, evolvability, sustainability), especially in AI- and microservice-based systems.

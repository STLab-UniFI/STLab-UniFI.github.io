The project **"Software Engineering Education and Training: Exploring Factors for Excellence (SEET-EFE)"** recieved funding from the [Fondazione CR Firenze](https://fondazionecrfirenze.it). 

The fund, amounting to 60.000â‚¬, will be used to design, optimize, and consolidate innovative educational processes in the field of software development, with a particular emphasis on the balance between practical skills and theoretical knowledge. The goal is to identify the key success factors needed to train individuals with solid practical competence to effectively implement what they want to achieve, as well as provide them with the theoretical skills necessary to conceive innovative and cutting-edge projects. 

By involving heterogeneous pedagogical partners present in the Florentine province, e.g. the [42 school by Luiss](https://42firenze.it/), the project will employ rigrous empirical methods to provide scientific evidence and advancements of software development education.

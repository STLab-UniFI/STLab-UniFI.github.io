We are delighted to announce that, as of the 12th October 2023, the 34th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE) has concluded in Florence, Italy.

We would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the more than 170 participants, all the keynote / invited speakers, the local student volunteers, and the  ISSRE organizing and steering committee for making this event possible.

The insightful discussions, innovative research presentations, and collaborative workshops have left us all enriched and inspired.

We are looking forward to seeing how these discussions shape the future of software reliability engineering.

See you next year in [Tsukuba (Japan)](https://issre.github.io/2024/).

Until then, from the STLab, keep innovating!
